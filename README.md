# Shortest Path
When I was initially faced with this problem, I opted to use the Codility coding environment. Unfortunately, it does a poor job of error handling, and after I had my main logic down bug fixing was extra difficult. The reason I initially opted to go this route was due to the platform recording keystrokes, and I was hoping to show my work and demonstrate how I think. This ultimately backfired in that I didn’t finish/solve the challenge, but it was a learning lesson should I ever use this platform again.

After being thoroughly defeated by the test, I couldn’t get it off my mind so I came back to solve it on my own. This is working from memory, and using as much of my old code as I could salvage. The big change is that I added in a Min-Heap to process priority rather than scanning an array – which boosts performance considerably.
